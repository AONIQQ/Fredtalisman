              <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                "By the time I found Fred Talisman, Cindy was ready to break up with me. I was devastated. She is the
                person I love more than anyone. She is my soul mate. She felt that she could never trust me again and
                that she could never forgive me. Before I found Fred, I had tried other things and spoke to other
                people, but not only were their methods ineffective, some actually made things worse with her! I saw
                couples counseling with Fred as my last resort but she wouldn't do it with me. I worked with Fred on my
                own while working with his home study course, 'Save Your Relationship.' I'm not geographically close to
                Fred's office, so I worked with him by phone. To my amazement, working with Fred by phone was more
                valuable than any help I've gotten in person. Thanks to Fred, she gave me a last chance. Fred gave me
                hope beyond hope. I was impressed with his depth of understanding and compassion. I saw the first
                improvements with her almost immediately after the first session I did with Fred. Cindy and I got
                married almost a year after the crisis that Fred got us through. Using the things that Fred taught me,
                my wife and I are now stronger than ever as a couple. Our relationship gets better everyday. And that's
                not all! She is now pregnant going on 20 weeks! I am so incredibly excited about what this little life
                will become. We are ecstatic. Everything is working really well. It's amazing. I'm very grateful and
                thankful for all of Fred's incredible help. The skills he taught me have also improved every other
                relationship in my life, including my friends, relatives, work mates and casual acquaintances. If
                everyone learned Fred's skills and put them into practice, the world would be a much better place. I
                really can't thank Fred enough and by the grace of God, I am on a much better track now with my wife.
                Fred not only showed me how to save my relationship. He also forever changed my life for the better.
                What I got from Fred is the most valuable help I have ever received." What a difference he has made to
                our lives. Words do not say enough about how grateful I am. Thank you again Fred. I can't thank Fred
                enough for all that he has done for us."

                "When I found Fred, our relationship was in a difficult place. We were in a vicious cycle. Unfortunately
                the choice in our home was to get upset and to not talk about issues for many days or weeks. I wanted to
                rekindle our relationship and definitely to save our marriage, but I realized that we couldn't do it on
                our own. I was afraid to go to a marriage counselor who would dig up the past and probably get us more
                upset at each other and make things even worse than when we started with them. The main reason I chose
                Fred was because of his problem-solving approach and his track record of finding solutions that work.
                Fred helped us to resolve the long-standing issues that were driving us apart. With his help we're now
                able to talk things out and to have the consistent emotional and physical intimacy we have both wanted

              <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                "Fred Talisman, a licensed marriage counselor for over 48 years, saves and revives a dying
                relationship. How does he do it? Well he's not the stereotypical marriage counselor who sits back and
                says "uh huh" and watches couples get more and more polarized as they further talk themselves out of
                their relationship by giving their laundry list of built up hurts and resentments. If a couple is
                drowning, he's the lifeguard and he jumps in and does whatever it takes to save them, to buy them a
                second chance, a turning point. I think he's a brilliant strategist. He uses his strategies to turn
                around years of pain. He uses them to defuse years of tension. He uses them to get the couple
                reconnected to the love and magic that brought them together in the first place. He demonstrates to them
                a path, a hope, a vision of the possibility of actually thriving together. To me, Fred is The
                Relationship Wizard. His ability to save dying relationships are his brilliance and magic. He forged it
                out of the heartbreak he witnessed countless times in his early years as a traditionally trained
                marriage counselor, experiencing over and over how that training was grossly inadequate in assisting him
                to save couples in crisis. He's a practical man. He knows from hard experience that by the time most
                couples go to a marriage counselor one or both may be ready to end the relationship and the window of
                opportunity to save that relationship is now, or never. When it comes to saving a relationship he's a
                bulldog. If there is a way to do it, he won't let go until he finds it. I think his strategies are a
                gift to couples."

                the issues were preventing us from being able to work them effectively. Trust had been breached as we
                "acted out" in various ways to relieve the stress. Fred provided both a supportive, safe container as
                well as the feedback necessary for us to separate the issues from our emotions and the issues from each
                other. He also taught us how to compartmentalize issues, breaking them down into simple negotiations.
                With his help, our marriage has transformed into a place where we can manage our relational and

                agreed to get help as a last gasp attempt to possibly save "us." I began the search for someone local,
                knowing that anyone we chose was a crap shoot at best. And I was feeling like if we are going to do
                this, I wanted to give us the best possible shot at a positive outcome. I found your info online, and I
                wish I could tell what it was that resonated with me, but something did and I convinced him to
                participate, at least to give it a try. Fred, it is hard to express in words the process, or how it
                worked (not trying to make it sound mystical here) but there is no doubt that it did. You brought
                clarity to so many issues and enabled us to rediscover the joy we had shared in each other in the past.
                We learned to laugh with each other again, and we have tools to keep any conflict from developing into
                something unnecessarily weighty. I believe we both feel that our communication skills and our depth of
                feelings for each other have been enhanced by the time spent with you. I wouldn't hesitate to share your
                contact with anyone who confided in me that they were concerned about the future of their

                together." Nothing felt more awful than being told by a professional that our relationship was probably
                doomed. We knew we loved each other – and I knew there had to be some better way. In desperation on that
                particular Saturday I googled "how to save my marriage" and that took me to Fred's website. Half an hour
                later we had him on the phone (on a Saturday, no less!). He asked us both one simple question, "Are you
                committed to saving your marriage?" Even though we were raw with anger, resentment, and hurt, we each
                said yes. And then he scheduled us a session for later that day. Ever since that first session Fred has
                been gently providing us with relationship skills we hadn't been taught before. His approach is
                non-judgmental, and deliberately – remarkably – simple, and his techniques do work quickly if you are
                dedicated to following the steps he's laid out for you. He provided us with time-tested ways to stop our
                fights before they start, and the techniques one needs to function more healthily in their relationship.
                Best of all he's started to give us a way to better accept each other the way we are – rather than try
                to change one another. And he does this without psychoanalysis or psychobabble. It is a very refreshing
                approach to couples counseling; He's not just a relationship saver, he's a relationship builder. Thanks
                Fred!"

                that we couldn't get past the infidelity, the lack of trust and his fear of commitment. I want to thank
                you for the guidance, support, and help you have provided. I have learned so much about myself,
                relationships, and how to communicate to others from you. Everything you said makes sense and everything
                you taught me to do worked and continues to work. I realize I can use your skills not just to keep my
                relationship strong but for the rest of my life. You've given me invaluable life skills. I teach all my
                friends what I learned from you so they're all getting the benefit of your help too. Thank you for
