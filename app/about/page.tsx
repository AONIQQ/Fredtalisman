                "Fred Talisman, a licensed marriage counselor for over forty eight years, saves and revives a dying relationship. How does he do it? Well he's not the stereotypical marriage counselor who sits back and says "uh huh" and watches couples get more and more polarized as they further talk themselves out of their relationship by giving their laundry list of built up hurts and resentments. If a couple is drowning, he's the lifeguard and he jumps in and does whatever it takes to save them, to buy them a second chance, a turning point. I think he's a brilliant strategist. He uses his strategies to turn around years of pain. He uses them to defuse years of tension. He uses them to get the couple reconnected to the love and magic that brought them together in the first place. He demonstrates to them a path, a hope, a vision of the possibility of actually thriving together. To me, Fred is The Relationship Wizard. His ability to save dying relationships are his brilliance and magic. He forged it out of the heartbreak he witnessed countless times in his early years as a traditionally trained marriage counselor, experiencing over and over how that training was grossly inadequate in assisting him to save couples in crisis. He's a practical man. He knows from hard experience that by the time most couples go to a marriage counselor one or both may be ready to end the relationship and the window of opportunity to save that relationship is now, or never. When it comes to saving a relationship he's a bulldog. If there is a way to do it, he won't let go until he finds it. I think his strategies are a gift to couples."
